  "summary": "The implementation addresses REQ-1, REQ-2, and REQ-3 by enriching orders with design mapping data in frontend queries. However, REQ-4 (RB order splitting preservation) appears incomplete - the backend supplyOrder function does not explicitly preserve karigarName and genericName fields when creating split orders.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Verify that RB order splitting logic preserves karigarName and genericName in both original and newly created order records",
      "reason": "The backend supplyOrder function creates readyOrder using 'originalOrder with' syntax but does not explicitly preserve karigarName and genericName fields. The diff shows the function but without clear evidence that these optional fields are being preserved during the split operation.",
