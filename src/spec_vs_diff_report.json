  "summary": "The diff implements 6 out of 8 requirements. It adds Status columns to the three tabs (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3), fixes Ready tab filtering to show only Ready status orders (REQ-4), fixes the Karigar filter UI by using SelectValue component (REQ-6), and adds mobile-friendly export logic for PDF/JPEG (REQ-7, REQ-8). However, the design code matching logic fix (REQ-5) for handling product prefixes is missing from the diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Fix the design code matching logic to correctly map Generic Name and Karigar Name from the master designs data when displaying orders in all dashboard tabs, handling cases where design codes may have product prefixes (CH, BR, H, etc.) that need to be stripped before matching against the base design codes in master designs",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any implementation of design code prefix stripping logic. The backend file (main.mo) is truncated and does not reveal any prefix handling code. No frontend file shows logic to strip prefixes like CH, BR, H before matching design codes. The requirement explicitly mentions handling unmapped codes like CHTMN40038, BRNOB41367, BRDZL45035, CHDZL6001GN, but no such logic is evident in the diff.",
