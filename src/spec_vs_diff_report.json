  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to the Excel parser (frontend/src/utils/excelParser.ts) with implementation of the parseMasterDesignExcel function for karigar mapping, but the diff is truncated at a critical point. Based on the visible evidence, REQ-1 appears to be implemented with column parsing logic, and the parser uses SheetJS for both .xls and .xlsx formats (REQ-3). However, REQ-2's enhanced error logging is not clearly evident in the truncated content, and the actual parsing logic for columns A, B, C is cut off.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Add enhanced error logging to the karigar mapping Excel parser to show exactly what values are being read from each cell during parsing",
      "reason": "The truncated diff does not show console.log statements that would display actual cell values being parsed for each row, or logs indicating header matching success/failure",
