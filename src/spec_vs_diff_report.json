  "summary": "The diff shows changes only to Dashboard.tsx, which adds useCallback memoization to handleFilteredOrdersChange. While this addresses part of REQ-2 and REQ-3, the implementation is incomplete. The tab components (TotalOrdersTab, ReadyTab, HallmarkTab, CustomerOrdersTab) mentioned in the requirements are not shown as modified in the diff, meaning their callbacks likely remain unmemoized and their useEffect hooks lack proper dependency arrays. The root cause identification (REQ-1) and comprehensive memoization across all affected components (REQ-3) appear to be only partially implemented.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure the onFilteredOrdersChange callbacks in TotalOrdersTab, ReadyTab, HallmarkTab, and CustomerOrdersTab do not cause parent component re-renders that retrigger the same callbacks",
      "reason": "Only Dashboard.tsx is modified. The four tab components (TotalOrdersTab, ReadyTab, HallmarkTab, CustomerOrdersTab) are not shown as modified, suggesting their internal callback implementations and useEffect hooks remain unchanged, which could still trigger cascading re-renders.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Add proper dependency arrays and memoization (useMemo/useCallback) to prevent unnecessary effect re-executions in the Dashboard and tab components",
      "reason": "Only Dashboard.tsx shows a useCallback addition. No modifications are shown for TotalOrdersTab.tsx, ReadyTab.tsx, HallmarkTab.tsx, or CustomerOrdersTab.tsx, meaning useMemo for filtered data calculations and useCallback for their internal callbacks are likely missing.",
