  "summary": "The implementation addresses most requirements but has gaps in REQ-1 (row selection visual feedback), REQ-5 (inline editing of design code), and REQ-7 (cascading updates verification). Export functionality improvements for iOS are implemented. Sidebar fixes are present. Order ingestion optimizations exist but error handling improvements are unclear.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix row selection highlighting across all dashboard tabs. Clicking anywhere on a row except the design column should select/highlight the row. Clicking on the design column should continue to show the design image popup without selecting the row.",
      "reason": "OrderTable.tsx implements row selection with handleRowClick and handleDesignClick with stopPropagation, but there is no evidence of visual highlighting styles (CSS classes or conditional styling) applied to selected rows. The code manages selection state but does not show implementation of visual feedback mentioned in acceptance criteria.",

      "requirement": "On the Master Designs page, enable inline editing of the design code column for each row.",
      "reason": "MasterDesigns.tsx shows a table with edit buttons that open EditDesignModal, but the modal only allows editing karigar (dropdown) and shows design code as disabled input. There is no evidence of inline editing capability for the design code field itself.",

      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Implement cascading updates so that when a design code is modified in the Master Designs page, all pending orders with that design code are automatically updated with the new mapping (generic name and karigar assignment).",
      "reason": "backend/main.mo is truncated and does not show implementation of reassignDesign function called in EditDesignModal. While EditDesignModal calls actor.reassignDesign(), the backend implementation is not visible in the diff to confirm bulk order updates occur. The truncated backend code shows only the method signature without implementation details.",
