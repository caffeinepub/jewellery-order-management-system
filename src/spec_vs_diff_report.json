  "summary": "The diff implements fixes for design mapping updates and Ready status transitions for SO/CO orders. Backend changes include a new migration module and updated order handling logic. Frontend changes focus on OrderTable mark-as-ready functionality, EditDesignModal error handling, UnmappedCodes page mutation handling, and TotalOrdersTab integration. However, several requirements are not fully evidenced in the diff, particularly the backend markOrdersReady function verification.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Verify the backend markOrdersReady function properly handles SO and CO order types and persists the status change",
      "reason": "No markOrdersReady function is visible in the backend diff. The OrderTable component calls saveOrder directly with Ready status instead of using a dedicated markOrdersReady function. This suggests either the requirement was not implemented or the implementation approach differs from what was requested.",
