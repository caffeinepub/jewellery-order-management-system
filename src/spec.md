## Summary
**Goal:** Fix Ready tab filtering, implement RB order splitting with supplied quantity tracking, and improve PDF/JPEG exports with design images on all devices including iPhone.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix Ready tab to display only orders with exact status 'Ready' (excluding 'StatusChangedToReady')
- Add supplied quantity prompt when marking RB orders as ready
- Split RB orders into pending and supplied quantity lines across Total Orders and Ready Orders tabs
- Fix PDF export functionality to work correctly on iPhone devices

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view accurately filtered Ready orders, split RB orders by supplied quantity for better tracking, successfully export PDFs on iPhone, and receive exports with embedded design images from the Karigar page.
