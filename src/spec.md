# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix PDF export to display actual design images and restore colorful formatting with green headers and proper sorting.

**Planned changes:**
- Embed actual design images from the Design Image Page into PDF exports by fetching uploaded images by design code
- Restore green header rows for each design group in the PDF
- Sort orders by design code numerically from lower to higher within each group
- Apply visual formatting with clear separation between design sections

**User-visible outcome:** PDF exports will show actual design images (like the gold chain for CHTMN40009) instead of placeholder text, with a colorful structure featuring green headers and properly sorted design groups.
