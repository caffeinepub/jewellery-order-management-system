          "description": "Update the return-to-pending click handler to call the backend batchReturnOrdersToPending mutation with the selected order IDs and their quantities. On success, display a success toast message (e.g., 'N orders returned to pending successfully') and clear the selection. On error, extract the error message from the mutation result and display it in an error toast. Ensure the orders disappear from the Ready tab list after a successful return by relying on the React Query cache invalidation from the mutation hook."
