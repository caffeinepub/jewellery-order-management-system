The parser must not swap day and month (no MM/DD/YYYY treatment). It must correctly handle dates from any year, including 2025 and 2026. Both string-format dates (e.g. '19/02/2026') and Excel serial numbers must resolve to the correct DD/MM/YYYY value. Dates currently showing as 'No date' on the dashboard because of failed parsing (e.g. dates like 13/02/2026, 16/02/2026 shown in the uploaded screenshots) must be displayed correctly after the fix.",
