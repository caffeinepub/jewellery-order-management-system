Instead, implement the following logic for RB orders being returned from Ready to Pending: (1) If the Ready order's supplied qty equals its pending qty (fully fulfilled case), create a brand-new Pending order line in Total Orders with qty = supplied qty and all other fields copied from the Ready order, then remove the order from Ready. (2) If the Ready order's supplied qty is less than its pending qty (partially fulfilled case), find the existing order line in Total Orders by base order number and add the supplied qty back to it, restoring its status to Pending if not already, then remove the order from Ready. All orders in Total Orders must always have Pending status.",
