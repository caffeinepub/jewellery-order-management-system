  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 correctly in TotalOrdersTab.tsx. A `getOverdueDays` helper function is added that calculates elapsed days from `orderDate` (nanoseconds), returning `-Infinity` for null/missing dates. After filtering, orders are grouped by design code, each group is sorted by overdue days descending (most overdue first, no-date orders at the bottom), then flattened back preserving group order. All existing filtering features (search, order type, karigar) are unchanged.",
