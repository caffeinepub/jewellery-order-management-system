  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements. REQ-1 is addressed in SummaryCards.tsx by excluding partially-supplied RB pending rows (via originalOrderId linkage), deduplicating RB rows by orderNo, and showing an 'N RB Pending' amber indicator. REQ-2 is addressed by the same SummaryCards logic restoring totals when the Ready fragment is removed (return-to-pending). REQ-3 is addressed in TotalOrdersTab.tsx via the consolidateRBOrders function that merges pending RB fragments by orderNo into a single row before display and before the SuppliedQtyDialog is shown. All changes are data/state level only with no UI/workflow/structural changes.",
