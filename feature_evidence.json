When 3 out of 4 qty are moved to Ready, the Total Orders summary cards must immediately reflect the reduced totals (count, weight=remaining_qty×gw, qty) for the remaining parent line, rather than staying unchanged. The fix must be symmetric: both the forward split path (move to Ready) and the return path (return from Ready) must recalculate all summary card values consistently.",
